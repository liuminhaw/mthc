## Overview
`mthc` currently supports the Markdown *Basic Syntax* as defined in the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/), plus one *Extended Syntax* feature: *automatic heading IDs*. Additional extensions are planned for future releases.

It ships with a built-in stylesheet based on the [Catppuccin color palette](https://catppuccin.com/palette/) and supports light/dark mode. Code blocks are highlighted with [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/). The CSS/JS required for styling and highlighting are embedded directly in the generated HTML. If you prefer a bare document, you can disable styling to produce plain HTML.

> **Note:** Custom stylesheets are not yet supported. As a workaround, disable the built-in styles and add your own CSS manually.


## Installation
Prebuilt packages are available for Debian/Ubuntu, RHEL/CentOS/Rocky/Alma, and Arch Linux (x86_64/amd64). Download them from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/liuminhaw/mthc/releases).

You can also build from source with `make` (see below).

### Debian based Linux
Download the `.deb` that matches your OS release, then install:

    sudo apt install ./mthc-{version}-{release}.{distro}_{arch}.deb

### RedHat based Linux
Download the `.rpm` that matches your OS release, then install:

    sudo dnf install ./mthc-{version}-{release}.{distro}.{arch}.rpm

### Arch Linux
Download the `.pkg.tar.zst` package, then install:

    sudo pacman -U ./arch-mthc-{version}-{release}-{arch}.pkg.tar.zst

### Building from source
1. Get the source for vX.Y.Z from the [release page](https://github.com/liuminhaw/mthc/releases) or clone the tag:
        git clone --depth 1 --branch vX.Y.Z https://github.com/liuminhaw/mthc.git
1. Install the required build dependencies:
    - `gcc` (C compiler)
    - `libunistring-dev`
    - `libpcre2-dev`
1. Build the executable:
        make

#### Runtime Requirements
Your system must have `libunistring` and `libpcre2-8` installed for `mthc` to run. If install from a package, these dependencies will be handled automatically.

## Usage
Using `mthc` is simple. Just provide a Markdown file and mthc writes HTML to standard output. Use `--output` to write to a file.

    mthc [options] &ltmarkdown_file&gt
     
    Options:
      --help             Show this help message
      --output=FILE      Specify output html file (default: stdout)
      --no-style         Disable CSS styling in the output HTML
      --debug            Enable debug logging
      --test             For testing purposes only
      --version          Show version information

The `--debug` flag writes verbose diagnostic output to standard error and is primarily intended for development.

## Supported Syntax
Currently supported markdown syntax includes:

### Basic Syntax
- Headings (levels 1-6)
- Bold and Italic text
- Blockquotes
- Lists (ordered and unordered)
- Code blocks and inline code
- Links and images
- Horizontal rules
- Raw HTML blocks
    > When using raw HTML in Markdown, the HTML block must be followed by a blank lineâ€”even after the closing tag. The parser treats everything from the opening tag up to the next blank line as part of the HTML block.

See the Basic Syntax reference [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

### Extended Syntax
- Heading ID
    > `mthc` automatically generates `id` attributes for headings based on their text. Custom IDs are not supported yet.
